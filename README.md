# Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Insights Using ML

This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning** to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing and spending behavior. By using clustering techniques such as **K-Means** and **PCA for visualization**, the project uncovers behavioral patterns that can support **personalized marketing, customer retention, and business decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Identify distinct customer segments based on spending and demographics  
- Analyze behavior patterns across clusters  
- Provide insights for marketing and business strategy  
- Build an end-to-end segmentation workflow using Machine Learning

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized customer data with features such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  
- Other customer attributes (if available)

> The dataset is used for learning and demonstration purposes.
